# Practicing Flexbox

## I feel like I am finally starting to make some progress

## Now I am able to at least position things on a page. It is far from perfect, and I will definitely pratice more. But, God, I feel so much better now

## I am also starting to learn some JS now, which makes me feel good and proud at the same time. I cannot wait to learn more and more
